# ADVANCED NLP -- Hands-on experiments.

This repository contains advanced practicals, complete with papers to explain the jupyter-notebooks and includes more detailed explanations.

Divided into two distinct parts:
  - Keyword Extraction -- Word & Sentence Vectors
  - Language detection, semantic spaces & attention exploration

## Keyword Extraction -- Word & Sentence Vectors
This part contains exploration and experiments on keyword extraction and word vectors. Divided into four sections: 
  - Keywords Extraction
  - Word Vectors
  - Prediction-based Word Vectors
  - Prediction-based Sentence Vectors  

The first section comprises advanced data pre-processing followed by multiple keyword extraction models (including a top-N implementation, tf-idf and KeyBERT)  benchmarked against one another.

The following section studies word vectors in an in-depth manner. It includes a distinct words algorithm implementation, a co-occurrence algorithm and a reduction in K dimensions algorithm, which enables plotting the embeddings.  

The third section explores Prediction-based word vectors. It studies the Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) model and compares the results with section two. It focuses on studying particular problems and goes in-depth into studying analogies.  

The final section studies the SentenceBERT (SBERT) model, and benchmarks its clustering abilities using different methodds.

An analysis of Bias is further conducted throughout this paper.
